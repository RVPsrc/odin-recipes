    <h2><strong>Ingredients</strong></h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Thick Cut Steak</li>
            <li>Thyme</li>
            <li>1 Head Garlic</li>
            <li>200g Butter</li>
        </ul>
    <h2><strong>Steps:</strong></h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring to room temp! This makes an amazing difference to cooking through evenly rather than ending up with a thick overcooked band in order for the very centre to be cooked to your liking;</li>
            <li>Pat dry and season the steak generously with salt and pepper – this helps form that amazing crust we all know and love about great steaks!</li>
            <li>Get your skillet <strong>SMOKING HOT</strong> before putting the steak in – again, for the crust</li>
                <ul><li><strong>WARNING:</strong> The butter will sputter when you add the thyme, so stand back!</li></ul>
            <li>Take the steak off the stove <strong>BEFORE</strong> your desired internal temperature because the internal temperature will continue to rise as it rests; and</li>
            <li><strong>REST</strong> your steak for 5 to 10 minutes so it sucks its own juices back in and the fibres relax. This is a must-do step for any protein you cook hard and fast!</li>
        </ol>
